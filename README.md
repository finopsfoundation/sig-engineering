# Introduction

The engineering SIG within the FinOps foundation is tasked with identifing how FinOps best fits into engineering practices. There are expectations put upon engineers by the FinOps practitioner which need to be sympathetic to the engineers perspective and well understood by all.

# Mission Statement

The SIG Engineering focuses on topics pertaining to how FinOps fits into the operation of services by engineering/DevOps teams. Additionally, it produces supporting material and best practices for end-users and provides guidance and coordination for FinOps Foundation projects working within the SIGâ€™s scope.

1. **Clarify and inform.** Provide valuable and objective information to the TAC, End Users and Projects of the FinOps Foundation regarding areas considered in-scope. Strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and project contributors. Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practically useful information.
2. **Collaborate and interrelate.** Effectively interface with other related groups internal and external to the FinOps Foundation and connect the dots to facilitate meaningful collaborative progression of relevant topics. Engage more communities and create an on-ramp to effective TAC contribution &amp; recognition.
3. **Assist and attract projects.** Helping to maintain the continued health of FinOps Foundation engineering-related definitions. Focus attention and resources on helping foster project maturity, systematically across FinOps Foundation projects. Clarify relationship between projects, FinOps Foundation project staff, and community volunteers. Identify gaps in the landscape of FinOps Foundation engineering definitions. Find and attract projects to fill these gaps through invitation to present, diligence on proposed projects, and in essence, act as a funnel for TAC project reviews in this area.
4. **Afford impartial stewardship.** Provide and maintain a vendor neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback. Establish procedures to assist where necessary.

## In Scope

* Foster, review and grow the ecosystem of engineering related FinOps projects.
* Identify and report gaps in the F2's project portfolio on topics of FinOps in Engineering to the TAC and the wider F2 community.
* Collect, curate, champion, and disseminate patterns and current best practices related to the operation of FinOps practices in engineering that are effective and actionable.
* Educate and inform users with unbiased, accurate, and pertinent information.
* Provide and maintain a vendor-neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback.
* Provide a ladder for community members to become involved with the technical oversight of projects within the SIG's scope in an open, transparent, and inclusive way.
